# hello-world
This is a project to explore and establish an initial Github repository.

Hi!

Welcome to my corner of Github. I hope to learn a great deal about different programming languages like Python and C#.

This is a place where I feel I can have a place to share my projects and establish a portfolio of my work.

I love tacos.
